<Strong>SaveALifeToday</Strong> has been created in 2012 with the purpose to provide people in India with a safe and timely access to donor blood.</p>
<br/>
<p>Almost every person in India has had to face a situation of urgent blood need and no donor within reach. Statistics says
that on average the demand for blood in India is not satisfied by official blood banks and that leads to the most tragic consequences. 
Many people die because they do not receive required help in due time.</p>
<br/>
<p><Strong>SaveALifeToday</Strong> is a non-commercial, non-profit organization that assists you in searching for a 
voluntary blood donor in your area. Thanks to good hearts and will of many people from across the country who agree to
be voluntary donors we could create this platform and bring together those in need of help and those who want to come to the rescue.</p>
<br/>
<p>We believe that we can make a difference. Blood is needed in India every minute and we hope that our efforts will help to
contribute to a good cause of keeping people alive and healthy. Shortage of blood is a problem that can be solved if we
stand together and raise awareness. Our website is the first step on the road to saving human lives and improving of 
mortality in India.</p>
<br/>

<p>With help of our website you can find an eligible donor in your area within a couple of minutes. You will be provided with 
contact details and can reach that person just in time to save a life of your relative, friend or patient.</p>
