  <h3>Its Healthy</h3>
  <p>From a health standpoint, I can't think of a better way for people with high blood pressure, migraines, or high cholesterol to let go of some waste. I do it to help with my blood pressure and migraines, as unloading two pints of blood is the best way for me to relieve pressure in my brain and my body. Furthermore, donating blood changes the iron levels in your body, thus helping, and sometimes preventing, heard disease. This is especially important for women. Why? After women stop menstruating, they are no longer getting rid of iron. In actuality, a woman's iron levels will increase after menopause. Giving blood is one of the safest and easiest ways to reduce levels of iron to healthy levels. Also, giving blood decreases the risk for heart attacks in men.</p>
  <h3>Self Rewarding</h3>
  <p>Knowing your donation will make a difference for someone else really makes you feel wonderful. Knowing that so few people actually do it, however you take the time to show up for every one of your appointments, says something about your character.</p>
  <h3>Saves Lives</h3>
  <p>Consider the individuals in the hospital needing a blood transfusion. A gunshot or accident victim. Any person needing an ample supply of blood while in surgery. These people need us, and what they ask for is very little. Just imagine what a few pints of blood can do and how many lives it can save.</p>
  <h3>Knowing Your Cholesterol Levels</h3>
  <p>One of the added benefits of donating blood is having access to cholesterol levels. Results are readily available to you online so you can gage what you need to change in your diet, or you may just want to maintain healthy levels</p>
  <h3>It Is Free</h3>
  <p>There are very few free things to do in the world so why not take advantage of one.</p>
  <h3>Makes You Stronger</h3>
  <p>Giving blood will make you a stronger person. Knowing you have the power to affect a life changes your mind and wheel. It teaches you about weakness. Why? The first few minutes when the flow is started your mind starts to race with apprehension. Why? Have you seen the needle! I'm not trying to terrify you, but even I, a person who has been receiving allergy shots her entire life, still get nervous. The way I get through it? I think about a saying a marine told me once when I wanted to give up because something was just too painful to bear. "PAIN is WEAKNESS leaving the body". Man did that statement stick! No pun intended</p>
  <h3>Why Not To Donate Blood</h3>
  <p>Less than 10% of the population actually donates blood. Why? Most individuals claim they are afraid to get AIDS; they are afraid of needles; they are too busy; they do not have enough blood to spare; their blood is rare; they are too old to donate blood. All excuses and most without merit.</p>
